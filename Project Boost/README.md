This was the one the first complete games i created.It has helped me to understand how Rigidbodies work, the Particle System works, what prefabs are and how to use them, basic components ( Transform, Mesh Renderer...) , etc.

In this game you have to make it to the finish point without touching the obstacles. It contains 4 level.
